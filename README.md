# MNIST Feature Engineering & Classification

This project explores classical machine learning approaches for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. We implemented a complete pipeline from image preprocessing to model evaluation, using feature extraction techniques and classifiers like Decision Trees and SVM.

##  Key Achievements

- **Feature Engineering**: Applied Sobel filtering and HOG to enhance edge features in MNIST images.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Used PCA to reduce feature space while preserving variance.
- **Modeling**:
  - Trained and tuned **Decision Trees** using Grid Search and K-Fold Cross Validation.
  - Trained **SVM** models on both raw and engineered features.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measured precision, recall, F1-score, and visualized confusion matrices and heatmaps.
- **Overfitting Control**: Investigated pre-pruning techniques to optimize tree depth and avoid overfitting.
